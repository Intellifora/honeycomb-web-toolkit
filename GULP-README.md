# Setting up Honeycomb with Gulp
## Overview
Each of the folders in [src] represent a Honeycomb module that can be imported.
In each module you will find a readme file that lists the dependencies of that module ([e.g.](src/base/README)).  Anything could happen if you import a module without it's dependencies.

Honeycomb provides unprocessed SASS files that need have some processing done to them as part of your build process.
Once this is done a module can be added by importing the _main.scss file in that modules css folder.
